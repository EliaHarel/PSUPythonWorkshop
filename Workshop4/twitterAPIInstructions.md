# Setting up a Twitter API account

To be able to connect to either Twitter's REST or Stream API. You need to have a Twitter API account. This can take a day or so to be approved, so please try to do this as soon as possible to make sure you can access the needed information for the workshop. Again though, if you cannot or do not want to setup an API account. We will have an alternative "demo" data set to work with. 

### Getting a twitter account
Pretty straight-forward. 

- Go to: https://twitter.com/
- Then click "Sign Up"
